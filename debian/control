Package: swupdate
Architecture: linux-any
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Built-Using: ${Built-Using}
Description: Software update framework for embedded systems
 swupdate is a Linux update agent with the goal to provide an efficient and
 safe way to update an embedded system.
 .
  - Install on embedded media (eMMC, SD, Raw NAND, NOR and SPI-NOR flashes)
  - Allow delivery single image for multiple devices
  - Multiple interfaces for getting software
    1. local storage
    2. integrated web server
    3. integrated REST client connector to hawkBit
    4. remote server download
  - Software delivered as images, gzipped tarball, etc
  - Allow custom handlers for installing FPGA/ microcontroller firmware.
  - Power-Off safe
