DPKG BUILD PROFILES
===================
There are some custom build profiles that are disabled by default:

pkg.swupdate.bpo
Build a backport friendly version of the package with some default features
disabled that would require unavailable dependencies.
Currently this targets bullseye.

pkg.swupdate.p11
Enable using PKCS#11 for AES decryption
instead of having the plain key available in a file.

pkg.swupdate.nohwcompat
Disable the comparison with the hardware compatibility file /etc/hwrevision.

pkg.swupdate.nosigning
Disable Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signature verification on SWU files.
Cryptographic hash verification (integrity) is still enabled with this set.
Please only use this when you can ensure authenticity in some other way.

pkg.swupdate.efibootguard
Enable support for handling of failure-safe update with EFI Boot Guard.

EXAMPLES
========
/usr/share/doc/swupdate/examples/udev holds an example on how to make SWUpdate
trigger installing updates on inserting USB flash drives with SWU files on them.
